# Voting_System
In “ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM” a voter can use his\her voting right online without
any difficulty. He\She has to fill a registration form to register himself\herself. All
the entries are checked by the DATABASE which has already all information about
the voter. If all the entries are correct then a USER ID and PASSWORD is given to
the voter, by using that ID and PASSWORD he\she can use his\her vote. If conditions
are wrong then that entry will be discarded.
